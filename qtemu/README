QtEmu
=====

QtEmu is a graphical user interface for QEMU written in Qt4.
It has the ability to run virtual operating systems on native
systems. This way you can easily test a new operating system
or try a Live CD on your system without any troubles and dangers.

Installation
------------
Download a source archive from the QtEmu project website
(http://qtemu.org/). Most probably you have already
done so ;).

Qt 4.2 is at least required.

LibVNCServer 0.9.7 is at least required. For the VNC socket feature, a
recent SVN build is required.

Compilation with cmake (recommended):
(Use this methode on Linux to install the project systemwide.)
* run 'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .' in order to
  install all files into /usr.
* type 'make install' as root
* start it now with qtemu

Compilation with qmake from Qt4:
* unpack the source tarball
* run 'qmake' in the qtemu folder
* type 'make'
* start ./qtemu and have fun!

Network Configuration:
  QtEmu will handle all network configuration for you on Linux. In
  order to support bridging modes, a few programs need to be
  installed:
     sudo
     ip
     route
     brctl
     tunctl
  along with kernel modules to make these utilities function.

  Additionally, so that QtEmu can automatically use these programs
  as a normal user, a few lines need to be added to the end of 
  /etc/sudoers as follows with visudo:

### rules for QtEmu ###
User_Alias QTEMU = %qtemu

Cmnd_Alias      QEMU_COMMANDS = /sbin/route, /usr/sbin/brctl, /usr/sbin/tunctl, /sbin/ip

QTEMU   ALL=NOPASSWD: QEMU_COMMANDS
### end rules for QtEmu ###

  You need to have the qtemu group, and your user needs to be part
  of it. Eventually QtEmu will do all this automatically for you, 
  but until then manual intervention is neccesary.

  One last note: the above paths should be correct in most cases,
  but if something doesn't work and debugging says that a command
  you know is installed is "unavailable", make sure these paths
  are right for you!

Have Fun!
